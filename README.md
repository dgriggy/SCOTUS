Statistically-Informed Neural Network for Marks Doctrine Analysis
Project Overview
This project develops a targeted deep learning framework to test sophisticated hypotheses about how Supreme Court justices utilize the Marks doctrine and its effects on judicial behavior. Rather than using traditional "black box" deep learning, we implement a statistically-informed neural architecture that leverages existing psycholinguistic research and computed statistical relationships as the foundation for model design.

Core Innovation
The key innovation is transforming pre-computed statistical discoveries into neural network initialization parameters and architectural constraints. This approach allows us to:

Encode decades of LIWC psycholinguistic research directly into the model structure
Use existing correlation coefficients and significance levels as network weights
Build theoretical predictions (H1 vs H2) as testable architectural constraints
Focus computational power on detecting subtle, higher-order relationships rather than rediscovering basic psycholinguistic patterns
Research Context
The Marks Doctrine Challenge
The Marks doctrine creates a natural experiment within Supreme Court jurisprudence. When no single majority opinion emerges, justices must navigate complex strategic considerations about how to position their arguments to either create or avoid becoming controlling precedent. This creates multiple layers of analytical opportunity:

Linguistic Strategy: Justices writing in Marks-applicable situations face different rhetorical challenges than in standard majority opinions
Temporal Evolution: How Marks application has changed over different Court eras
Individual Variation: How different justices adapt their writing strategies when Marks applies
Hypothesis Framework
H1: Genuine Disagreement Hypothesis
Plurality opinions reflect authentic intellectual disagreement among justices, characterized by:

Higher authenticity scores in plurality vs majority opinions
Stronger correlation between case salience and linguistic complexity
Consistent individual justice patterns across different case types
H2: Utility Maximization Hypothesis
Plurality behavior reflects strategic positioning to maximize individual utility, characterized by:

Cognitive inconsistency patterns suggesting strategic rather than authentic reasoning
Systematic differences in analytical language when strategic opportunities arise
Non-correlation between authenticity and analytical complexity (suggesting performance vs genuine belief)
Data Structure and Advantages
Dataset Characteristics
Size: 1,415 Supreme Court opinions with robust subgroup sizes (n~100-200)
Temporal Span: Multi-decade coverage enabling historical trend analysis
Feature Richness: Comprehensive LIWC psycholinguistic measures plus case metadata
Hierarchical Structure: Natural nesting of cases within years, years within Court eras
Why This Dataset is Ideal for Deep Learning
Information Density: Supreme Court opinions are linguistically rich documents where each case carries substantial analytical signal
Natural Hierarchies: Temporal and categorical groupings provide built-in regularization against overfitting
Validated Measures: LIWC scores represent decades of psycholinguistic research, providing pre-validated feature relationships
Clear Theoretical Predictions: Specific hypotheses about expected relationships enable targeted model architecture
Methodological Framework
Traditional Statistical Limitations
Traditional approaches to this research question face several constraints:

Correlation Assumptions: Most statistical tests assume independence between predictors, but LIWC measures are naturally intercorrelated
Linear Relationship Assumptions: Standard regression cannot capture complex, non-linear relationships between sentiment measures and strategic behavior
Multiple Comparison Problems: Testing many related hypotheses inflates Type I error rates
Temporal Complexity: Traditional methods struggle with nested time series within hierarchical groupings
Deep Learning Advantages
Our statistically-informed neural network approach addresses these limitations by:

Leveraging Correlations: Treating LIWC intercorrelations as information to exploit rather than problems to solve
Non-linear Relationship Detection: Capturing subtle patterns that suggest strategic vs authentic behavior
Integrated Hypothesis Testing: Building statistical testing directly into the learning process
Hierarchical Temporal Modeling: Simultaneously modeling short-term (year-to-year) and long-term (era-spanning) patterns
Neural Architecture Design
Layer 1: Psycholinguistic Feature Integration
Purpose: Process LIWC measures while respecting their validated correlation structure

Implementation:

Initialize connection weights using computed correlation coefficients from statistical analysis
Apply significance-based learning rate modulation (high significance = low learning rate)
Preserve interpretability of individual LIWC measures while learning optimal combinations
Statistical Input Required:

Correlation matrices between all LIWC measures
Significance levels for each relationship
Distribution parameters for normalization
Layer 2: Hierarchical Context Modeling
Purpose: Capture temporal and categorical hierarchies in judicial decision-making

Implementation:

Attention mechanisms that weight different time periods appropriately for specific hypotheses
Justice-specific embedding layers that capture individual behavioral patterns
Court era context vectors that encode institutional differences
Statistical Input Required:

Temporal trend coefficients (to be computed)
Justice-specific consistency measures
Era-based comparison statistics
Layer 3: Hypothesis Testing Integration
Purpose: Simultaneously evaluate H1 (genuine disagreement) vs H2 (utility maximization) predictions

Implementation:

Separate processing pathways for each hypothesis with constraint functions
Permutation testing framework integrated into training process
Statistical significance estimation for hypothesis-specific predictions
Statistical Input Required:

Directional predictions with effect sizes
Baseline comparison statistics (plurality vs majority opinions)
Expected vs observed relationship patterns
